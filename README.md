### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Siegfried.

Here are a few of projects I'm working on
  - Throttled Batch Execution Queue (this is very useful for developers if you have long build times and you need to build before you push your code)
  - Azure Active Directory B2C & Kubernetes demos (I think this might turn into a book proposal)
  - Universal SQL command line tool
  - C++ Tutorials for a new youtube.com channel
