### Hi there

I'm Siegfried.

Here are a few of projects I'm working on
  - Throttled Batch Execution Queue (WCF/MSMQ)
    - This is very useful for developers if you have long build times and you need to build and run unit tests before you push your code.
    - I've been using this for years and it is also very useful for backups that take a very long time (because of slow large capaicty thumb drives)
    - While I started a WPF version on github, most of my work is with command line tools I have not checked in yet.
  - Azure Active Directory B2C & Kubernetes demos (I think this might turning into a book proposal)
  - Universal SQL command line tool
  - C++ Tutorials for a new youtube.com channel (my new webcam & microphone just arrived today!)
